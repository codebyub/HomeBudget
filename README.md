## General info
This is my final project for postgrade studies - Java Web Developer. 
I like to keep my expenses under controll, so I thought it would be a great idea to use my own app instead of excel sheets. Using this app you'll to be able to enter current expenses and compensate with available balance. Optionally you'll be able to indicate some other savings, and plan near-future expensenses with possibility to estimate your balance.

## Inspiration
So far I was inspired for the name of my app with the [Witcher OST](https://youtu.be/hqbS7O9qIXE "Toss a Coin To Your Witcher") song. You can make laught, but I loved this song from its very first tone. Later on I'll share some technical references, while my code will be developed.
